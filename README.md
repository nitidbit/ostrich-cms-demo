To run locally

Make sure you have typescript installed, you may want to install it globally
`npm install -g typescript`

install lexicon

`npm install @nitidbit/lexicon`  (you will need NPM_TOKEN set in your environment - needs to really be public - maybe new package NPMjs.org - wanna publish it just at github which has a registry which lexicon uses)


`npm run dev`
